# Particle Simulator

## How to Use
Navigate to */particle-system/index.html* and open it with any browser. (It should work with any browser but I only tested it on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari).

### Run Simulation
Click any of the options in the sidebar to begin that simulation.

### Pause/Resume Simulation
Click anywhere on the simulation screen (not the sidebar) to pause/resume the current simulation.
